    <p class="center-text"><em>The Keller Hall Atrium, which is where I held office hours twice a week, for students.</em></p>
    <p>In <em>January 2023</em>, I accepted an offer to be an <strong>undergraduate Teaching Assistant</strong> for <em>CSCI 1933: Intro to Data Structures & Algorithms.</em> 
        This position involved and helped me develop a lot of <strong>time management, coordination, leadership, and communication skills.</strong> My main duties were to 
        lead labs and hold weekly office hours so that I can help students in the class get <em>a better understanding of Java and other intermediate programming concepts.</em> 
        I also helped in the administrative side of things with grading projects using JUnit tests and grading midterms with a provided rubric, as well as 
        editing/updating lab and project writeups using <em>LaTeX</em>.
