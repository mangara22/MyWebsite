            <li><u>CSCI 2033: Elementary Computational Linear Algebra</u></li>
                <p>This is the other CSCI class I took in the <em>Spring 2023 Semester</em>, the main topics for this class were
                    <strong>Linear and Geometric Algebra, along with Linear Transformations</strong>, some of the topics covered were: 
                    <strong>vectors, spaces/subspaces, linear combinations, linear independence/dependence, matrices, 
                    inner and outer product, orthogonality/orthonormal basis, and geometric product.</strong>
                    This class was very <strong>proof-heavy</strong>, but it helped me to gain a more fundamental understanding of <em>linear and geometric algebra.</em>
                </p>
            <li><u>CSCI 2021: Machine Architecture and Organization</u></li>
                <p>This is one of two CSCI classes I took in the <em>Spring 2023 Semester</em>, the main topics were learning 
                    <strong>how to program in C, then into x86-64 Assembly code, computing Architecture, 
                    and processing systems/environment.</strong> I would say the last third of the class were especially built
                    off of the first main topics of the course, as we studied <strong>how CPUs and Memory works, along with performance optimizations
                    </strong>using previous knowledge of earlier topics such as <em>pointers, registers, etc</em>. Furthermore,
                    we studied areas such as <strong>Virtual Memory, the ELF file format, and linking.</strong>
                </p>
            <li><u>CSCI 2011: Discrete Structures</u></li>
                <p>I also took this class in the <em>Fall 2022 Semester</em>, the main topics were <strong>Logic, Sets, 
                    Cryptography, Induction, Combinatorics, Relations, Graphs, and Trees.</strong> This course helped to develop 
                    my <em>thinking and problem-solving skills, especially with proofs,</em> that will be essential in computer science later on.
                </p>
            <li><u>CSCI 1933: Intro to Algorithms and Data Structures</u></li>
                <p>Took this class in the <em>Fall 2022 Semester</em>, this was taught in <strong>Java</strong> where I learned 
                    about OOP and basic data structures such as <strong>Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues, Binary Trees, and 
                    HashTables.</strong> I also learned about basic algorithms such as <strong>Bubble Sort, Binary Search,
                    Merge Sort, Breadth-first-search and Depth-first-search.</strong> In addition, I also learned 
                    other concepts too, such as <em>abstraction, inheritance, exceptions, and Big-O notation.</em>
                </p>
            <li><u>CSCI 1133: Intro to Computing and Programming Concepts</u></li>
                <p>I took this class in the <em>Spring 2022 Semester</em>, this was taught in 
                    <strong>Python</strong> where I learned basic programming concepts such as <strong>loops, recursion, 
                    conditionals, File I/O, iterating through a string/list, etc.</strong>
                </p>
        </ul>
