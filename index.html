        <p>My Computer Science Journey began back in my junior year of high school when I planned on being an aspiring
            Engineer. But after taking an <em>Intro to Programming</em> class that
            used Visual Basic and Scratch, I decided to see what else the field had to offer by taking <em>AP Mobile Computer Science Principles</em> in my senior year
            along with a <em>Web Design</em> class. These classes really sparked my interest in Computer Science and coding in general
            that it made me decide to be a Computer Science major.
        </p>
        <p>The journey continued when I took CSCI 1133 at the University of Minnesota, this class was taught in <em>Python</em>
            and it was a course meant to introduce students to basic programming concepts. I remember having a lot of fun in that class
            as every new topic was like equipping a new tool to my growing toolbox of computing knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>Today, I am a junior majoring in <strong>Computer Science</strong> at the <em>University of Minnesota 
            Twin Cities, class of 2025</em>. In addition to having learned <em>Python,</em> I have also learned languages such as <em>Java</em> and <em>C</em> to name a few. 
            I also have some relevant experience by being a <strong>Teaching Assistant</strong> for a computer 
            science course taught in <em>Java</em>, helping other students get started with their computer science journey similar
            to how I started out back then.
        </p>
        <p>In my free time, I like to watch and play Tennis from time to time as one of my hobbies. I also enjoy biking around the 
            beautiful University of Minnesota campus and the city of Minneapolis.</p>
